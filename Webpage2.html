                    scientists had no ideas how galaxies formed. According to all observations at the
                    time, galaxies formed during a single epoch very far back in the history of the universe. In the
                    absence of direct evidence, astronomers formed two theories: the theory of accretion, in which blobs
                    of stars came together to form galaxies; and the theory of collapse, in which galaxies were formed
                    in the collapse of an enormous gas cloud.</dl>

                <dl style="color:antiquewhite;font-family:verdana;background-color: rgb(23, 138, 149);"> In late 1996,
                    scientists got their first view of galaxy formation, looking back in time 11 billion years
                    to see clumps of young star clusters gradually banding together into a galaxy. It is too early to
                    fully
                    dismiss the gas collapse theory, however; there may be more than one way to form a galaxy.</dl>

                <dl style="color:antiquewhite;font-family:verdana;background-color: rgb(23, 138, 149);">When Hubble
                    first
                    devised his classification scheme, he thought that the different types of galaxies
                    represented different evolutionary stages; they started as one type and gradually evolved into
                    another type. We now know that his theory was true, though the phrase gradual evolution is something
                    of a misnomer.</dl>

                <dl style="color:antiquewhite;font-family:verdana;background-color: rgb(23, 138, 149);">Elliptical
                    galaxies are formed by the collison of two spiral galaxies. The process is
                    slow—scientists estimate that it takes nearly half a billion years for the merging spiral galaxies
                    to smooth into an elliptical galaxy—but can be quite violent. Although galaxies are mostly empty
                    space, gravitational interaction between stars can cause them to explode into supernovas. More
                    important, gravitationally induced collisions between clouds of interstellar hydrogen gas can create
                    intense heat and pressure that can trigger the formation of new stars.</dl>

                    One clue to the evolution of galaxies is the distribution of different types of galaxies at
                    different distances from us. Because light travels at a finite speed, when we look at a distant
                    galaxy, we are seeing the galaxy as it appeared in the distant past when the light left it. Some
                    types of active galaxies, such as quasars and BL Lax objects, occur only at great distances from us.
                    They existed when the universe was much younger, but no longer exist. Many astronomers therefore
                    think that active galaxies are an early stage in the evolution of galaxies. If this idea is correct,
                    an astronomer living now on a distant quasar might see the quasar as a normal galaxy, and the Milky
                    Way in its earlier active stage as a quasar.

                    However galaxies formed and evolved, the process must have occurred quickly very early in the
                    history of the universe. The age of the oldest galaxies appears to be not much younger than the age
                    of the universe. Though astronomers now have some support for theories of galactic formation and
                    evolution, they are still searching for more evidence and trying to understand the details.
